- Client-side DOM encryption:
    - Text should not be selectable in the browser, the text is not copyable when inspecting the window, but the desired encrypted content is still being rendered on the screen. 
    - Contemplating 'crypto' options  
- Added the GIF to the README to allow for a preview for potential users.
- Current most functioning feature is the rendered story. The user is not able to see blocks they have not read yet, questions appear under each block, and a score is automatically beiung calculated as the quiz goes on.
- After meeting with client, we will be reformatting each story into a 5-section module. Since this will require reformatting of text stories, progress of the application will be slightly delayed.

- As of 3pm, I am now created another test database variable according to the new format provided by the client.
